# Structure algorithm implementation

Implementation of the algorithm described in the article "Inference of Population Structure Using Multilocus Genotype Data". This is work in progress. The idea is to start with the most basic model and to gradually add more complexity.

## To do

- [ ] Add reader of str files
- [ ] Add output of algorithm
- [ ] Create a way to test the algorithm performance
- [ ] Add explanation of the algorithm
